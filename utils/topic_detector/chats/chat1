kashmir by led zeppelin is the best song ever. 
led zeppelin is amazing.
yes they are.
8:29 AM me: hey
  got your email
 gershon: k
 me: let's start with number 2 for now
8:30 AM and we can focus on 1 and 3, 4 when we complete our series A
 gershon: k
 me: i have some ideas on how we can do that
  you know, i was looking at google base
 gershon: yeah
8:31 AM me: and the shopping engines apis, etc.
 gershon: there are a lot of APIs out there
 me: and I think a big part of the vision that we need to figure out at this point
  is where all the data in each vertical will come from
  also
8:32 AM gershon: k
 me: at a high level
8:33 AM I think we'll want to identify all the NN capabilities of the site soon and document them
 gershon: Yeah, I can write up the possibilites
 me: also, there is an API we'll need to worry about
8:34 AM so that we can easily create a single point of access for Mobile APS
  and for a developer network
 gershon: You mean our API
 me: yeah
  you see
 gershon: hmm...
 me: if we think about these things, we can hire people accordingly
8:35 AM gershon: right
  We get an idea-structure of the software, and then turn it into a people-structure
 me: right
8:36 AM gershon: There are ways we could go for implementing unlimited APIs
8:37 AM We could really systematize implementing the APIs, but I think we still want a limited number of result types
 me: here's the thing
8:38 AM we are building the brain of the borg
  like you said it
  an AI system it is
  a big part of strategy now is
  looking at the various things people look for and do on the web or in chat
8:39 AM so that we can provide the necessary tools, so that people don't have to ever leave chatyeo
  chatyeo in many ways, is the web
  only inside out
  rather than a bunch of jargon and then links so people can leave and see an article or picture
 gershon: So, basically, we need to take everything people do on the web, and ask how will people do this on chatyeo?
8:40 AM me: we bring all that stuff to the surface and let them discuss it right there, like an examaning station
  yeah
  for example
  if I'm in a chat, discussing vacationing
  and where I should take my family
  i'll probably want a map, listing of hotels and reviews
8:41 AM if I'm talking about soccer, I'll probably want to see players, schedules and sports news
  the good news is, someone has do ne the hardwork for us
  ie. created google maps
  ie. created yelp
8:42 AM gershon: right there are even NLP systems for parsing voice about travel reservations
 me: ie. created reuters
 gershon: I wonder if we can leverage that kind of stuff
 me: in the future
  we'll talk about that next
  but, the bad news is
8:43 AM there is a TON of work in store for us just to cover these areas and correctly implement each API and further mashup data
  I can't trust interns
  to look at this
  it's a huge mental jog
 gershon: right, we can further systematize the API implementation process
 me: i want to begin designing all of the verticals
8:44 AM and their members' respective features and metadata combinations
  google base offers housing, jobs, events and products
 gershon: right
8:45 AM and we can integrate the same thing with yahoo and other apis
 me: freebase provides a sort-of governance to all that and it's own data
  what is the relationship?
 gershon: The tricky part is if you implement from two different APIs, they sometimes have similar but not quite the same data
 me: what is the relationship between the wikfiyer algortihm and what freebase can provide
  and can we be a step ahead of the game and prove concept before implmentation
8:46 AM gershon: Freebase is more about how much topics are related. The wikifier stuff just more or less takes the topics from the text
 me: that's why you have to have a clear understanding of what you are expecting out of the combination and then you work to manually validate
 gershon: right
 me: freebase is also a unique database
  with good info
  like, who were all the case of SNL
  and what were each of their ages
8:47 AM it's in relational data structure form
 gershon: right, there >1000 tables
 me: really?
  thats' it so far?
 gershon: That is quite a lot of tables
8:48 AM Each table has lots of columns
 me: oh
 gershon: It has structure for lots of types of data
8:52 AM me: I'm wondering if it is too complicated
  and whether it will ever gain massive tracktion
  it seems that all these amazing sites
  lack interactivity with their users
  same old social networking and forum like commenting systems
8:53 AM gershon: Wikipedia is the mothership of a lot of these
 me: imagine a day in the life at chatyeo, you browse the web, chatyeo knows everything you look at, you post questions or comments in places your interested, chatyeo updates you when those conversations pick-up
 gershon: Could wikipedia be on the left side, with the popup a wikipedia editor
8:54 AM me: yeah
  i've thought of a full features browser
  that's where WayFind comes in
  but there are other ways to implmenet a larger view of the data being discussed
  pdf viewers, etc
8:55 AM gershon: The thing about wikipedia is you can EDIT the data not just read or comment on it
 me: i want people to think of chatyeo
  as such:
  the topic is the query
8:56 AM and the chat is the controller and the stage is the results or view
  and the people use the chat to control the view
  by doing this, they create the results
  its a search engine created by people
8:57 AM not by us or by a bot or by anyone else
  we could market Chatyeo in so many brilliant wasy
8:58 AM gershon: If the results are wiki, people would be able to edit the left side too
  in the hover
 me: it's not wiki
  to that extent
  it's a neural network
8:59 AM meaning, we use sensory inputs instead of explicit directions
  like, when a person does something naturally
 gershon: So, eventually we want to aim for machines writing the content on the left?
 me: if you are hungry and I put a cheeseburger in front of you and a bucket of sardines
  you will go to the cheeseburger
 gershon: k
9:00 AM me: there is enough good data out there
  all we have to do is assume that people will enjoy it if it's organized better visually and priority wise
9:01 AM instead of paginatino
  pagination
  we have rewind
  i'm telling you, we re-invented everything
 gershon: right
  Will we need summarization?
 me: we have it
9:02 AM gershon: We have limited screen space
  Then wayfinder for the rest, or fit more into the hover?
 me: well
  that's where you come in now
  that hover has lots in store for it
 gershon: k
9:03 AM me: and, people will fall inlove with certain hovers, and we have to ensure they can get back to those hovers
  thus, they are to be followed as are broader rooms
9:05 AM the tricky part is getting this right
  meaning
  we have it right now
  but will it end up the way we envision it now
  if we do, how can anyone deny us raving reviews
9:06 AM there is enough technology and feature invested in the software
  so that it will be reviewed carefully and seriously by all the major PR groups on the web
 gershon: right
9:07 AM We need relevant hovers for each topic
  We need tracking of how users use the site, so we can improve the UI experience
 me: let me worry about that
  i'm on a roll
9:08 AM that data is all bullshit
  it boils down to philosophy
  and knowing that something isn't right
  about the web as we know it
  it's about knowing that the experience today can be turn inside out and on it's head
9:09 AM when that is clear, you'll begin thinking about all the obvious things you'll need in a new way
 gershon: k
 me: its sorta like the mentality garret put into the iphone
9:10 AM he said, you wouldn't design a new phone and design a rotary dialing system for it
  you'd think of better ways to make it easier and more intuitive, but at the same time, it has to make sense
9:11 AM where the heuristic due dillegence comes into play
  is in the HHI
  i think I've understimated this challenge for us
  the whole 50 rules project
9:12 AM stemming from scenarios based on our research of broader conversational scenarios and behavior
  with this data, we'll know better how the data should be presented and what data should be presented when
9:13 AM gershon: I suppose we could chart the data in the interaction
 me: if this can be dynamic and AI like
9:14 AM yeah
  so AI is about knowing what this discussion is about
 gershon: For a restaurant something like:
9:15 AM MAP Menu User Preferences
 me: there are multiple layers
  yeah,
 gershon: The conversation will got back and forth between the different data
9:16 AM me: I think you should look at HTMs to see what they offer in this way
 gershon: What are HTMs?
 me: Hierarchical Temporal Memory
9:17 AM http://www.numenta.com/
9:18 AM think about how your brain works
9:19 AM your brain is not like a roll of flim
9:20 AM it's more like a timeline with multiple relational nodes along the way
  when you try and think back to third grad
  grade
  and you try and picture yourself
  your brain assembles that momemnt
9:21 AM it starts with a body, then your mind processes what the height and average weight should be of that boy and fills it in with clothing, color and begins to draw the rest of the room around it, as necessary
  you know your standing in a building, but you don't add color to that building or think about the bricks on it until you zoom out a little and try to process it, sorta like gmaps
9:22 AM gershon: just the essential features
9:23 AM me: the HTM algorithm is sorta like this from what I understand, probably not as close to that analogy, which I had this morning while showering, but still, htms may offer a structure for our system to notice change in pattern
9:24 AM gershon: HTM is for image processing
9:26 AM I think we have for each interaction type, a list of data sources, views of those data sources, and an active view at any given point in time
9:27 AM Sporting events might have as data sources: player bios, new about players, player statistics, in-field video, score cards, fan commentary, coach commentary, fan views, etc.
9:28 AM We can construct views off of this from different data sources
9:30 AM How does this mesh with the different data type views?
9:33 AM me: well
  we will never be able to hard code these mappings in our system
  although, it is not impossible to identify them
  and position them
9:34 AM if we have recognized a pattern
  there is a pattern that forms when discussion forms and when results form
  sorta like my analogy with the neocortex
9:35 AM and the way I feel we think
  there are validations that occur
  when pattern matches are successful
  and the system should know to sustain those patterns while moving onto finding others
  quite simply
9:36 AM gershon: right
  What is the best way to graph the process?
 me: some governing process
  should understand the varios states of the conversation
9:37 AM and the permutations in it or changes in context
 gershon: Can we assume the conversation is a linear process?
 me: yes
  if it deviates, it will come back eventually
  and that's also why we have rewind
  here's the thing
9:38 AM in order to know where you are going, you have to know where you have been
  and it's ok to deviate
  and change
  direction
  there may be some consistancies that hold
9:39 AM it may all change
  but the system must know what was important by judging the sensory imput
  and quite simply
  all that is, is measuring the interactiving of the results area
  and lending various actions theirin different weights
9:40 AM so there the main chat has an additional layer
 gershon: right with different layes
 me: to consider
9:41 AM we'll obtain our more granular control from the metachats and actions in WayFind
  to the high level chatters, it could appear to be mind blowing
  if they don't realize that people are in much more detailed discussions than what they have mentioned
  so if I say HTM's vaguely
9:42 AM there could be 2-3 meta discussions already happening somewhere
  where progression and advancmenet is rapidly transcending
  this data is important for that high level viewer and it must be packaged up nicely for him
9:43 AM this is why our search can outperform any known to man
 gershon: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_hidden_Markov_model
9:44 AM me: have you looked at this?
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_hidden_Markov_model
  wondering if that's similar to our layers
9:45 AM retrieval is important
9:46 AM but dechypening meaning is also important
 gershon: It looks like lhmm is in parallel
  hierarchal has the hierarchy and sub-states
 me: that's what our system does, don't forget
  we are taking chat by surprise just as much as we are search
9:47 AM when a student asks his teacher to explain something or challenges what he has said
 gershon: I need to look more and see what the technical definition of htm
  is is
 me: that process can be more valuable that simply being able to find a document
  for example
  when I bought all those books
9:48 AM it was valuable
9:49 AM but what was equally valuable was the ability to work with another source, human, or text, that could help me decyphen what I was reading
  the two abilities combined are key
  but,
  there is something about this occurance that I find interesting
  it's the moment when a document or a book is interpreted
9:50 AM and it's the breakdown of these interpretations
  that flag critical points in the document
  i think there is data there that we can capture
  and analyze
9:51 AM by stayin on its trail
  you can easily lose wind and be lost on this one
  people will do it for you
  remember, so it's not so bad
  but if our bots don't have their eyes peeled
9:52 AM they will not do justice to our system
  here is one more example of what I just said
  when you read an amazon review of a book
  people tend to analyze certain sections of the book
9:53 AM secitons where the author has either drawn attention to something important
  the reader is either agreeing with them or scrutanizing them
  in an area
  i find these areas to be important
  if 10 reviewers of a document
  draw attention to this influction point
9:54 AM *inflection
  now
  these inflection points are interesting
 gershon: right
 me: and our body should be doing the work to find
  more information about them
  rather than miscellenious
  nouns, etc.
9:55 AM we can't be rhyming without reason
  if you want to be an algorithm guy
  you have to be a theory guy first
  one who understands the primitive problem
9:56 AM more than the numbers, equations, and reports
  i need you to be that guy
 gershon: k
 me: and follow me, challenge me, but most importantly, someone who doesn't let this chat vaporize
9:57 AM it will not be easy, and there will be moments when this stuff can be discouraging
 gershon: I'm trying to take notes on where to go with this, but it isn't easy
 me: here's one more thing to remember
  take this entire chat for example
  i wouldn't parse this chat
  in chatyeo
  to try and point to 100 different new places
9:58 AM i would archive it in the appropriate location first and foremost
  and when there are numerous other similar conversations
  i should hope to find patterns between this class of a conversation
9:59 AM gershon: right
 me: when the higher level subjects throught a grouping of these chats
  rise to the surface
 gershon: Right, for now we have a very simple conception of a topic
  We can look for more complex relationships between text
10:00 AM me: right, we look for clues
  and let our readers draw the conclusions
  its about knowing when to say, HHMMs
10:01 AM if you look at a huge mind map of the field of AI
  it's too much to learn
  to many directions to head in
  *too
  most all of what you'll see is irrelevant when your truly after something specific
10:02 AM this is where other people put in your situation in the past can help
  other people in your situation will say things in a general order that mark a tiny trail
10:03 AM enough of these tiny trails will combine to form a stronger scent
  and they can recombine easily
  taking bits and pieces from eachother
10:04 AM as I chat with you
  these tiny trails emerge from the brain
  based on relevancy
  and provide me with what I may be saying next
  or visual indicators
 gershon: right
 me: search at it's finest
10:05 AM but, how we get there is different from how others get there
  becuase our search shows us the future
  it's 2 steps ahead
  its a form or prediction
10:06 AM gershon: So we have 1) process chats of where the point of the chat is to go between different states and 2) topic chats where you are swirling around searching for just the right nugget of data
  Both can be present in the same chat too
 me: yeah, I think that's a correct assesment
  try it again
10:07 AM gershon: There is the process of getting to information, which is learning process in itself, and then there is the actual information we are searching for
10:08 AM me: of course
 gershon: We need to relate both with past chat experience
  The process has states, which can also have sub-states
10:09 AM me: yes
  it grabs the pieces it needs on the fly
 gershon: Right
10:10 AM me: you tend to look at things from the machines perspective
  i look at it from the neuro perspective
  which is fine
  we need to do that
10:11 AM gershon: I want to figure out how the ideas are eventually going to convert into an actual algorithm
 me: i think the answer is simple
  and I can diagram it
  right
  no, that's great
  we are on the same page
  we have to just talk about it alot
  when it makes sense in our head
  the algorithm will write itself
10:12 AM it's not too hard to grasp either
  there are excersizes we can perform also
10:13 AM print 15 chats about some closely related subjects
  and try to identify patterns in them and see how if combined, what the benefits would be
 gershon: yeah, I'd like to try this stuff out somehow, but it is hard to figure out what data to try it on
10:14 AM me: there is always a trail of interconnected information
  there are master trails
 gershon: I suppose we can map out conversations literary analysis style
 me: and smaller trails that stem from the main path
  the trick is to fit everything and keep them on this path
10:15 AM theoritically, from day one, this trail will grow and not need supplementation
  if that can be done, the algorithm we create may very well be applicable to everything
  but, besides that
10:16 AM from the top down
  there should always be a clear understanding of the highest level node in the topic
10:17 AM and the child nodes must always know where they fit in the picture
  from there, the branches will form
  and to use another analogy
  these branches are more like roots
10:18 AM the more they grow
  the bigger the plant gets
 gershon: yeah
 me: so these roots will grow in many directions
  soaking up nutrients from the soil
  the better these roots understand eachother, the better the plant will grow
10:19 AM gershon: I'm going to try to writeup/prototype how to actually create a technical implementation of this
 me: good
  go for it
  i will catch you later
  i'm up by my moms with kids
  no beers this weekend
  but next, I want to have a bbq with the company
 gershon: k
 me: we'll grab dinner this week sometime
  maybe tamarind
 gershon: k
  You going back to NYC?
 me: that place seems to inspire some creative thinking
  no, valley
10:20 AM NYC should be coming here
 gershon: When you leaving?
  k
 me: as soon as fenwick sorts out a few things
  maybe 7-8 days
  the want me to meet like, 15 of the valleys most important players
  they want to vouch for me
  they saw the prototype
10:21 AM i might meet danny hillis, etc
  he's the founder of freebase
  i'd like to try and get him on our board
 gershon: k, so Martin Logn and Ophir are now on the board?
10:22 AM Have the two of them met?
