/**
 * This class very simply weights topics according to how important they are within the document.

 * This is done heuristically (without any training), by comparing how often the topics are mentioned, how spread out these mentions are in the document, and (most importantly) how strongly they relate to other topics that are mentioned.
 * <p>
 * Although the resulting weight will always be between 0 and 1, it is not a probability.
